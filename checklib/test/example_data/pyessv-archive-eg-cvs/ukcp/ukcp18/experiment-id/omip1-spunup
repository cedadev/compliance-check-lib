        "description": "Same as the omip1 experiment except that it is not initialized with observed climatologies; rather it is initialized with results from at least a 2000-year spin up of the coupled physical-biogeochemical models. The spin up simulations may be made with the classic online or offline approach, or with tracer-acceleration techniques or fast solvers. If an online approach is used, at the end of the 5th cycle of CORE-II forcing, the model's physical fields should be reinitialized to the values at the start of the 3rd cycle in order to avoid long-term drift in those fields and to assure that they will not diverge greatly from physical fields in the omip1 simulation. The spin up also includes radiocarbon to evaluate deep-ocean circulation",
